<h2> Annyeonghassaeyo Chingu! My name is Ashley from BSIS 1-D!</h2>
<p> <font color=#7B241C size=5 face=cursive>	This is my Home Pageeee. Well, we are tasked to say something about ourselves and Im a bit talkative 
so better brace yourselves for this will be a long one. I hope that you brought a tinie winie patience with you. 
I really wish you'd find this introduction an interesting one and read it until the very end for you to get to know me better.
 I do not know where to begin so I'll just write whatever comes to my mind first. Okay then, so let's start.</font></p>

<p><font color=#7B241C size=5 face=cursive> 	I am a person who dreams to have a life lived in the fullest. I try everything that seems interesting to me whenever I
can. I love to lay in bed all day as much as I love to work my butt off. I love watching korean dramas, laugh and cry alone like crazy.
Romantic- comedy is the best for me, as well as suspense and revenge genre.
I love cooking for others. I love to bake though I'm not that fond of sweets. I love delicious dishes, one with lots of veggies.
I am a night person who loves looking at the moon smile, as the stars twinkles. I love the rays of morning sun on my skin.
I love to daydream, think of what I wanted to do in the future. I love softserve vanilla icecream, so as cookies
and cream.
 I prefer chicken than pork, mocha than chocolate, cookies than curlz, and carbonara than spaghetti. 
I love brownies. I love it so much that I could eat it up all day.
 I love Ariana Grande her songs are my escape. I stan Got7, I love Kim Yugyeom the most. I love to bop in Paramore's music.
I love the smell of saute', freshly baked bread, new books, gasoline, hair, sea breeze, and popcorns in the Cinema.  I love hanging
out with my friends. I love spending time with my family.</p>

<p> 	I could be quiet at times in person but believe me I could be the most talkative one you'd enconter.I could be
everyone's friend. I hate being in a crowded and noisy places. I want solace.  I don't want it when others misunderstood me.
I want fairness in everything, what you do is what you get. I love helping in any way I can, I just feel so happy 
knowing I am of any help to anyone. There's just so many things I love. Even so, there are always a negative side on everything.
 I am very straight forward, I hate sugar coating of words. At times I procastinate. I don't study a lot. I am not good 
at deciding, I always bomb my descisions. Sometimes I could be dumb. I don't catch up on things easily. I'm not good at understanding metaphors.
I get anxious on my attitude towards a person, I feel like I'm being rude though I'm not. I often mess things up.

For now, I make the most out of life. Enjoying things. As long as it makes me smile, that's what makes it all worthwhile.<br>
p.s. I hate cats grr.
